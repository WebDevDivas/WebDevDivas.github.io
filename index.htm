<h1>Web Dev Divas</h1>

<p>This is the start of the beginning.</p>
<p>Now we have both of us working on the files together, using an organization so we can collaborate.</p>
<p>We will use FORKED repositories to duplicate our own User versions of the WebDevDiva/home repository into our own accounts.</p>
<p>Then, from our altered User repositories, we will submit Pull Requests to submit our changes to the main WebDevDiva/home repository.</p>
